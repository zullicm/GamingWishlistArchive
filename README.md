# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### json-server --watch db.json

Having a json-server globally installed and running this code is required to run the websites features as all data stored in the background will be on this server.
I have added some data to the db.json just as reference so that the pages aren't empty when loaded.

# GamingWishlistArchive
This is a website I built for my phase-2 project in the Flatiron school. The project is meant to be a place to hold all the games you have played and or want to play. I took inspiration from other websites that do the same thing but for other topics. The main purpose of the website is to store games giving you the opportunity to rate them, while giving them a small description and also what platform you played them on. There is also a favoriting system where if you click the favorite button they will be added to the favorites tab. The last feature is the wishlist. This is a place to add games maybe you cant yet afford, they aren't out yet, or have them in your vault for a rainy day so that you dont forget they exist.
